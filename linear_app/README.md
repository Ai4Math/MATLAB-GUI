### THIS ONLY WORK WITH THE SETUP DOWNLOADED FROM THIS GITHUB REPO, IF YOU ARE STARTING FROM SCRATCH, YOU MAY NEED TO CUSTOMIZED THE TABLE AND BUTTON NAME AND SOME STUFF

# Linear Algebra App (In Progress)  

<br> 

# TODO: Desgin and Implement Function
#### Done: CheckSpan, Check Linearly Independent, All in Comsubspace.m, Rows operations (Dswaprow, Dmulrow, Daddrow), RREF, Solve Unique Solutions.
#### Not Done: Ploting stuff; Determinant stuff (CramRule, FindDet); MLX Files: Span + Linear Trans + Subspace and Plot, EigenValue and EigenVector.
#### Classification: Matrix outputs text (good), Matrix outputs Matrix (good),  Matrix outputs plots (hard one, do later)
#### Check for input exceptions later ...
