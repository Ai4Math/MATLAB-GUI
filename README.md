# MATLAB-GUI

This project simplifies Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra concepts with interactive simulations and real-world engineering examples using MATLAB and Python, guided by Professor Heze Chen from the University of Virginia's Department of Applied Mathematics, inspired by UVA's APMA 2120 and APMA 3080 courses.
